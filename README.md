# Persistences
Enter a number and this project will tell you what the additive and multiplicative persistences are for that number.

The additive persistence of a number is the number of loops needed to keep summing its digits until you reach a single digit number.
The multiplicative persistence of a number is the number of loops needed to keep multiplying its digits until you reach a single digit number.
